## The Problem

Contest site here: https://icfpcontest2021.github.io/

> **Problem definition**
> The goal is to assume a pose with a given figure so that it fits into the given hole, while scoring as many
> points as possible.
> The figure and hole are both located on a two-dimensional grid. They both consist of line segments that all
> start and end at a point with integer X and Y coordinates.
> Figure 2: The “Lambdaman” problem
> A hole is always a simple polygon: this means the line segments of the hole will not intersect, and there
> will be no further holes within the hole. A figure consists of line segments that may connect to other line
> segments at the start and end points.
> Assuming a pose works by moving the start and end points of line segments into a new configuration. This is
> of course not without constraints, since our stick figures cannot break the laws of physics!
