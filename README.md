## The Problem

Contest site here: https://icfpcontest2021.github.io/

> **Introduction**
> After cleaning up bit rot in underground mines and communicating with aliens, an era of peace and leisure
> has arrived in Lambda land. This has lead to a number of TV game shows really taking off. One of these is
> Brain Wall, a contest originating in Japan. Many local versions of this have aired across the globe and it is
> sometimes better known as Human Tetris or Hole in the Wall.
>
> An automated system moves a styrofoam wall towards the player. This wall has a hole cut out, and the goal
> of the game is to assume a position with your body that allows you to fit through the hole in the wall. But
> just fitting through the hole is not enough: in our variation, fully automated judges will count the number of
> dislikes, which the participants try to minimize.
> More background information about Brain Wall can be found on the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_Wall). You can also watch
> some samples of the TV show on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DYJXSSgW08).


> **Problem definition**
> The goal is to assume a pose with a given figure so that it fits into the given hole, while scoring as many
> points as possible.
> The figure and hole are both located on a two-dimensional grid. They both consist of line segments that all
> start and end at a point with integer X and Y coordinates.
> Figure 2: The “Lambdaman” problem
> A hole is always a simple polygon: this means the line segments of the hole will not intersect, and there
> will be no further holes within the hole. A figure consists of line segments that may connect to other line
> segments at the start and end points.
> Assuming a pose works by moving the start and end points of line segments into a new configuration. This is
> of course not without constraints, since our stick figures cannot break the laws of physics!
